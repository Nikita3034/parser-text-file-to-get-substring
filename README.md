## Problem:

    There is a text file with several user and bot dialogs. It is necessary to isolate those user 
    requests to which the bot could not give a correct answer.

## Solution:

    You can take an example text file and upload it. Or upload your file, 
    but for this you will need to replace the values:
    `countSymbols, findFirst, findSecond`
    with the ones that suit you (the description of the variables is in `script.js`).
